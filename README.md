# Classic Design Patterns in Typescript

## Which are the most important GoF Design Patterns for job interviews?

The most important Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns for job interviews often depend on the specific job role and the company. However, some patterns are commonly discussed due to their wide applicability and the depth of understanding they require. Here are some patterns that are frequently asked about:

Singleton: This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single "singleton" instance. It's a simple pattern that is often used and misused, making it a common discussion point.

Factory Method and Abstract Factory: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create suitable objects based on input or context. They are common in many codebases, making them important to understand.

Observer: Also known as "Publish-Subscribe" or "Event-Subscriber". This pattern is widely used in modern systems, especially in UI development and event-driven programming.

Strategy: This pattern allows you to select an algorithm's behavior at runtime, making your code more flexible and loosely coupled.

Decorator: This pattern is useful for adding new responsibilities to an object dynamically. It's a key pattern in understanding the concept of "composition over inheritance."

Command: The command pattern is essential in many frameworks for handling actions, requests, or events.

Adapter and Facade: These patterns help to design better interfaces and hide complexity, which is a common requirement in real-world software development.

Prototype: Although less common, the Prototype pattern can be important in JavaScript-based interviews because of the prototype-based nature of JavaScript.

It's worth noting that understanding the principles behind the patterns (like encapsulation, open/closed principle, dependency inversion, etc.) and when to apply them is more important than memorizing the patterns themselves. Interviewers often look for your ability to use these patterns to solve real-world problems, rather than just knowing the theoretical part.

## Which are the most important GoF Design Patterns?

It's challenging to rank the Gang of Four Design Patterns by importance because their relevance and usefulness depend on the specific problem you're trying to solve. However, I can provide a list of the patterns and group them into three tiers based on their general applicability in software development. Keep in mind that this is just a rough guideline, and a pattern's importance may vary depending on your project.

### Tier 1 (Most Commonly Used):

Singleton
Factory Method
Abstract Factory
Builder
Prototype
Adapter
Bridge
Composite
Decorator
Facade
Flyweight
Proxy
Observer
Strategy
Template Method

### Tier 2 (Less Commonly Used, but Still Important):

Chain of Responsibility
Command
Iterator
Mediator
Memento
State
Visitor

### Tier 3 (Least Commonly Used or More Niche in Application):

Interpreter

Remember, the importance of a design pattern is dictated by the context in which it's used. So, it's essential to familiarize yourself with various patterns and understand when to apply them based on the specific problem you're trying to solve.
